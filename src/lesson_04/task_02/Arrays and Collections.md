6 differences between Arrays and Collections are following:

Arrays are fixed in size but Collections are dynamic in size (automatically expand in size when needed).
With respect to memory arrays are not good to use but with respect to memory Collections are better to use.
With respect to performance its better to use arrays but with respect to performance collection are not good to use.
Arrays can hold only homogeneous elements but collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous elements
Arrays don't have ready made methods but collections have ready made data structures and methods.
Arrays can hold both primitives and wrapper objects but collections can hold only objects (including primitive wrapper classes, such as Integer etc).
